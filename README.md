Few plots and sims of covid spread

I plotted some of the publicly available data on transmission mode, case serverity, patient age etc.

I fitted different growth equations to predict time til hospital beds and ventilators were at capacity.

Then I moved to an SAIR model to model the spread of the disease. Then made it more complex by adding severity, re-infection etc. Then added the effect of interventions on the time to bed/ventilator capacity.
